# Stop doing your math homework
Tool collection to automate the solution of mathematical exercises

```py
import sdymh
sdymh.thank_you() # :)
```

## Installation
Like the majority of the students, you do not have `git` and you just 
discovered it when you saw this page. No problem, you can download the project
easily by [clicking here](https://github.com/antoninhrlt/sdymh/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). 
This will give you a "zip" file, decompress it[¿](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLBSS3JjAh0).

I wanted to make something easy-to-use for any student, so I did not make 
something like a library to download with `pip`... \
It's simple : open the `use.py` file at the directory's root, and then you can 
use "sdymh", run what you did by entering this line in your command prompt[¿](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE9WgNr3OjM) 
: `python3 use.py`[¿](#i-do-not-have-python) 

## I do not have Python
No problem, in Windows 10, open the Microsoft Store, type "python 3" in the 
search bar, select the latest version, and click to "install". or go [here](https://python.org).
