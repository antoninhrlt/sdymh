# Simple class to create a mathemetical vector with a name and its position
# in the plan
# NOTE : Could be called as `sdymh.Vector()`
#
# Example : 
# ```py
# u = Vector("vec u", 5, 3)
#
# # Mathemetical way to write it :
# # u = (
# #   5
# #   3
# # )
# ```

# The table uses colors for the vector names, if this raises some display bugs
# in your terminal, you should call this function with parameter `colored` set
# as `False` : `print_table(foo, colored=False)`
# 
# TODO : same but as GUI
